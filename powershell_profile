# TODO figure out some way to actually deploy this w/ dotbot, so changes are
# tracked immediately, rather than needing to copy this to my dotfiles repo
# manually (can i make $profile a windows shortcut or something like that?
# something like a symlink supported?)
# TODO if nothing else, maybe make aliases for the copy to / from dotfiles?

# Edit this file by typing the following in a powershell:
# vim $profile

# Currently copying this with:
# cp $profile ~/src/dotfiles/powershell_profile

Set-Alias -Name py2 -Value C:\Python27\python.exe

Set-Alias -Name vi -Value vim

# TODO try to make this just return the .Source variable
# (get-command <command>).Source works manually
# TODO and modify to get full Value for an alias if <cmd> is an alias?
Set-Alias -Name which -Value get-command

# TODO TODO make an alias (maybe to some more complicated fn) that searches
# all directories (non-recursively) in current dir for a */Scripts/Activate.ps1
# script, and runs it to activate the python virtual environment
