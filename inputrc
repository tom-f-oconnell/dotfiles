# TODO TODO possible to fix how this seems to lose specifity after first up
# arrow? (ex: "git submodule" -> <up arrow> (produces one relevant match) ->
# <up arrow> x 2 -> now a match is just "git status"
# (looks like it's reached the end of the matches? way to visually indicate that
# or stop the search?)
# (now using Pg[Up/Dn], after matches end i (at least in my testing so far) get
# (arg: <n>) <last matching history command>

# TODO anyway to prevent the above behavior?
# (searched around a bit for all of the above, and no luck...)

# This was to enable up/down arrow to search history for partially entered
# commands (wanted to search commands where current partial command is a prefix
# of the former)
# https://askubuntu.com/questions/59846
## arrow up
#"\e[A":history-search-backward
## arrow down
#"\e[B":history-search-forward

# PgUp
"\e[5~": history-search-backward
# PgDn
"\e[6~": history-search-forward

# So commands modified from a history search don't change the original history
# entries, or something like that.
