fix youcompleteme install. subtree?

setup encryption for just the sensitive lines in things like irssi config, pypi
config

clean things like recently opened files out of librecad, openscad, and other
configs

add openscad

automate vim plugin installation / submodule updates / unbreaking
automate YouCompleteMe installation (./install.py --clang-completer)

firefox plugins (maybe only if firefox is detected as installed)
-want standard interface to copy / paste urls / file list
+multiple tab handling

install GithubCloner requirements

how to add all scripts to path / symlink them to somewhere that in it?

include instructions for how I would like to install VIM plugins (Vundle?
pathogen (does it support github?)? submodules?

deal with ipython configuration (so it doesn't confirm on exit and stuf)
see:
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7438112/disable-ipython-exit-confirmation
file should be at:
~/.ipython/profile_default/ipython_config.py

manage things like librecad / inkscape settings (that change a lot w/o much
meaning) in some way where conf gets updated from that in git, but otherwise
keeps local changes (which might have things like recently opened files), or
at least overwrites local version with bare git version when necessary, but
otherwise doesn't track local changes (possible?) (may require manually
entering local changes into git..., by copying files or something)

probably delete storage and linking of .variables here (maybe rename it too)
b/c it seems like it's all deployment specific stuff. and if it isn't, maybe
it should be. probably want some file for that. maybe copy a commented
template?

script to set up these things (as much as possible?) within WSL bash
(different paths for configs at a minimum. some other things need set.)
  (see some of my chrome bookmarks under music_production folder)
+ test that vimrc option to disable bell in WSL has no effect outside 
  windows
+ need to change vimrc vundle begin call in windows install only?
  how do i want to manage?
  see: http://www.edwardhk.com/os/windows/install-youcompleteme-for-vim-in-win10-bash-ubuntu/
+ script all changes to WSL terminal, which I manually changed by right clicking
  the top of a WSL bash window -> Properties:
  - Options -> Use Ctrl-C / V as copy paste
  - Layout -> Screen Buffer Size -> Height (change from ~63 -> 1000 for more
    history i can scroll up to see)

other things not automated for WSL setup:
- changing home folder to a non-buried one
  https://superuser.com/questions/1132626

- change WSL settings so Unix permissions can work in normal Windows folders (my
  understanding)
  https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46610256

- adding line to ~/.profile to disable less/man/git diff error bell
  https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36724209

- change ls to not error w/ some windows shortcuts (but still look OK)
  (do NOT want this to apply to ubuntu most likely)
  https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/445917

- uncomment / add that 'set bell-style none' line to /etc/inputrc
  (need sudo)

- setup ~/.ssh dir w/ correct permissions?
  (should be possible w/ 'metadata' option?)
