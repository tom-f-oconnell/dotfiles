- after reading this (and similar posts, some linking to this):
  https://devblogs.microsoft.com/commandline/do-not-change-linux-files-using-windows-apps-and-tools/
  i'm not so sure moving my WSL home directory to be equal to my windows
  home directory was a good idea...
  might want to re-organize things, and that will affect my options
  for trying to get dotbot working on windows too
  
  see also:
  https://www.reddit.com/r/bashonubuntuonwindows/comments/fty89r
  (this last microsoft link might have the kernel of a real solution)
  https://devblogs.microsoft.com/commandline/whats-new-for-wsl-in-windows-10-version-1903/

- TODO force (check) git bash or similar is used to run dotbot on
  windows (not WSL because symlinks created in there don't seem to work for
  windows programs, and probably not powershell because of all the bash parts 
  of dotbot)
  (if there is an environment dotbot could actually succesfully be run from,
  that would set up files accessible / modifiable from both WSL and windows,
  then yea force that, but as-per the above TODO item, i'm not sure this is
  possible)
  - clean all current symlinks that were created from WSL bash
    (for example, check git bash can load ~/.profile)

fix youcompleteme install. subtree?

setup encryption for just the sensitive lines in things like irssi config, pypi
config

clean things like recently opened files out of librecad, openscad, and other
configs

add openscad

automate vim plugin installation / submodule updates / unbreaking
automate YouCompleteMe installation (./install.py --clang-completer)

firefox plugins (maybe only if firefox is detected as installed)
-want standard interface to copy / paste urls / file list
+multiple tab handling

install GithubCloner requirements

how to add all scripts to path / symlink them to somewhere that in it?

include instructions for how I would like to install VIM plugins (Vundle?
pathogen (does it support github?)? submodules?

deal with ipython configuration (so it doesn't confirm on exit and stuf)
see:
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7438112/disable-ipython-exit-confirmation
file should be at:
~/.ipython/profile_default/ipython_config.py

manage things like librecad / inkscape settings (that change a lot w/o much
meaning) in some way where conf gets updated from that in git, but otherwise
keeps local changes (which might have things like recently opened files), or
at least overwrites local version with bare git version when necessary, but
otherwise doesn't track local changes (possible?) (may require manually
entering local changes into git..., by copying files or something)

probably delete storage and linking of .variables here (maybe rename it too)
b/c it seems like it's all deployment specific stuff. and if it isn't, maybe
it should be. probably want some file for that. maybe copy a commented
template?

script to set up these things (as much as possible?) within WSL bash
(different paths for configs at a minimum. some other things need set.)
  (see some of my chrome bookmarks under music_production folder)
+ test that vimrc option to disable bell in WSL has no effect outside 
  windows
+ need to change vimrc vundle begin call in windows install only?
  how do i want to manage?
  see: http://www.edwardhk.com/os/windows/install-youcompleteme-for-vim-in-win10-bash-ubuntu/
+ script all changes to WSL terminal, which I manually changed by right clicking
  the top of a WSL bash window -> Properties:
  - Options -> Use Ctrl-C / V as copy paste
  - Layout -> Screen Buffer Size -> Height (change from ~63 -> 1000 for more
    history i can scroll up to see)

- option to automatically backup all config files that would need to be deleted,
  for links to be made?
  (+ option to restore from that backup)

other things not automated for WSL setup:
- changing home folder to a non-buried one
  https://superuser.com/questions/1132626

- change WSL settings so Unix permissions can work in normal Windows folders (my
  understanding)
  https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46610256

- uncomment / add that 'set bell-style none' line to /etc/inputrc
  (need sudo)

- test that path in gitconfig can be replaced by either ~ or $HOME, and do that
  if so. otherwise, change on WSL install to replace w/ new $HOME (which is NOT
  /home/tom. it is /mnt/c/Users/tom/src now)
  (works on windows w/ git 2.17.1, though still should test on ubuntu)

- need to either fix ssh_config permissions on ubuntu (assuming git just won't
  track / commit them in windows) to 600 (double check correct perms online) OR
  have a windows specific deploy that changes permissions to correct value after
  cloning (doing this now, but delete if former is possible).
