fix youcompleteme install. subtree?

setup encryption for just the sensitive lines in things like irssi config, pypi
config

clean things like recently opened files out of librecad, openscad, and other
configs

add openscad

automate vim plugin installation / submodule updates / unbreaking
automate YouCompleteMe installation (./install.py --clang-completer)

firefox plugins (maybe only if firefox is detected as installed)
-want standard interface to copy / paste urls / file list
+multiple tab handling

install GithubCloner requirements

how to add all scripts to path / symlink them to somewhere that in it?

include instructions for how I would like to install VIM plugins (Vundle?
pathogen (does it support github?)? submodules?

deal with ipython configuration (so it doesn't confirm on exit and stuf)
see:
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7438112/disable-ipython-exit-confirmation
file should be at:
~/.ipython/profile_default/ipython_config.py

manage things like librecad / inkscape settings (that change a lot w/o much
meaning) in some way where conf gets updated from that in git, but otherwise
keeps local changes (which might have things like recently opened files), or
at least overwrites local version with bare git version when necessary, but
otherwise doesn't track local changes (possible?) (may require manually
entering local changes into git..., by copying files or something)

probably delete storage and linking of .variables here (maybe rename it too)
b/c it seems like it's all deployment specific stuff. and if it isn't, maybe
it should be. probably want some file for that. maybe copy a commented
template?
