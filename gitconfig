# This `less --quit-if-one-screen -m --mouse +Gg` shows percentage like I want for long
# output, but the output takes up the full screen for files shorter than one screen,
# which makes it not worth overall. Adding `--tilde -s -S -R` options didn't seem to
# help. See https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/329093 for possible wrapper-based
# solution. See my question https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/676057 for a
# possible solution without making a wrapper.

# This does seem to cause all sorts of problems though...
# TODO fix / try deleting and see if current git+github behavior is annoying enough to
# warrant this
# This works for both pull and push. No need to set remote when first setting up.
