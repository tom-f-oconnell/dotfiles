- something to check if two objects are the ~same thing, just translated /
  rotated

- something to print the maximum bounding box of all
  (visibile-with-nonvisible-children? / particular types? / just visible?)
  objects, to see what size bed (+ working height) is needed to print stuff?
  - maybe (just/also) print sorted by longest dimension too?

- make this it's own repo -> submodule it in dotfiles?

- script to add lines as in thefourtheye's answer here:
  https://askubuntu.com/questions/289337
  to config that enables opening step mimetype/extension in FreeCAD
  by default gui click?
