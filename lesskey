# Was trying to get search to wraparound from bottom back to top in manpages.
# See `man lesskey` for more options.

# https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/255862

# Requires at least less v568 (20.04 has 551 by default and I haven't found a PPA yet)
##command
#/ forw-search ^W
#? back-search ^W

# Didn't seem to produce the behavior I wanted (though author said he tested it in
# v530)
##command
#\eB back-search
#\eF forw-search
#/ noaction gg\eF
#? noaction G\eB
